Some patients may have no chest discomfort but present solely with jaw, neck, ear, arm, shoulder, back, or epigastric discomfort or with unexplained dyspnea without discomfort. If these symptoms have a clear relationship to exertion or stress or are relieved promptly with nitrates, they should be considered equivalent to angina.

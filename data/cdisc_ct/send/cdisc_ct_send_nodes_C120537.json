            "definition": "The property of a body or region of space that determines whether or not there will be a net flow of heat into it or out of it from a neighboring body or region and in which direction (if any) the heat will flow, perceptible by living organism as a somatic sensation of cold or heat. It is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic motion of atoms and molecules. Temperature is measured in one of the three standard temperature scales: Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit. (NCI)",

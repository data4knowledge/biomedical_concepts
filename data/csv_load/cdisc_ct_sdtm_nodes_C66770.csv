"3762","Degree Celsius","A unit of temperature of the temperature scale designed so that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees and the boiling point is 100 degrees at standard atmospheric pressure. The current official definition of the Celsius sets 0.01 C to be at the triple point of water and a degree to be 1/273.16 of the difference in temperature between the triple point of water and absolute zero. One degree Celsius represents the same temperature difference as one Kelvin. (NCI)","C42559","C","Degree Celsius","http://id.d4k.dk/dataset/cdisc/ct/v48/sdtm/C66770-C42559"

"3765","Degree Fahrenheit","The Fahrenheit temperature scale is named after the German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), who proposed it in 1724. In this scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the boiling point is 212 degrees, placing the boiling and melting points of water 180 degrees apart. In this scale a degree Fahrenheit is 5/9ths of a Kelvin (or of a degree Celsius), and minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit is equal to minus 40 degrees Celsius.
